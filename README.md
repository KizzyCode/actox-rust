# actox
Welcome to my `actox`-library ðŸŽ‰

`actox` is small and dependency-less crate that implements a shared message dispatcher to publish and subscribe on
multible topics from different threads. This allows for trivial multi-producer/multi-consumer networks without the need
to manually establish and manage dedicated communication channels between all participants.

## Design considerations
This crate is opinionated. The main goal is to have simple code that hopefully just works. No external dependencies, no
super-duper custom lock-free maps etc. No `unsafe`. Therefore is probably not super efficient or fast (even though it
achieves a throughput of about 7 million messages per second on my platform).
